# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into a training set (`train.csv`) and a test set (`test.csv`). You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Approach

We approach the problem of predicting survival on the Titanic as a binary classification task. We explore the data, perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature engineering, and then train several machine learning models on the training data. We evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics and tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
